## General information

This project was created mainly for practice in Java. It realises a calculator which supports only the above mentioned operations. The UI was made as modern as possible with hover effects, onclick button borders change and etc. In this version though, it has no setup options still. In a future release, the sections Setup, Usage and Screenshots will be filled with content since they all rely on the project being able to be setup. I should note that the calculator supports only numbers which integer part have no more than 25 digits and fraction part with no more than 10 digits. This was made purely because the number would overflow the text field of the calculator.
